    <h3>let me tell you a bit about myself</h3>

    <p class=intro>My name is Yasmeen Al-khateeb, I am 25 years old, I have graduated from Petra University in 2018, I majored in pharmacy. I worked as a pharmacist for two years, after that I quit my job and decided to go in a different path. I find programming to be very interesting and fun, that’s why I’m here.
